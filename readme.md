# Game App Analysis

-Selected topic

Our group decided to look at phone app data, targeting specifically on games and see what features are drivers to success.

-Reason they selected the topic

The reason we chose this topic is because we were interested to utilize the things we learned into real life application and were generally interested in how ratings for phone apps come about.

-Description of the source of data

Our data is from Kaggle, where the source was obtained through scraping of millions of Android smartphone logs & app meta data.

Source data: https://www.kaggle.com/kboghe/android-apps-metadata

-Questions they hope to answer with the data

Through this project, we are hoping to find out what are the main features that cause a game app to succeed/fail which is approximated by its ratings by users. We will first preprocess the given dataset that will then be put through a machine learning algorithim to help build a model that will determine a game app's rating. A successful model will allow for real life application where mobile game creators can use this to tune their game for greater chance of success.
