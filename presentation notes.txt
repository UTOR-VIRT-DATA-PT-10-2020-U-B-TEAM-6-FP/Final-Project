Intro

-What makes a game app successful?

Dataset

Kaggle: app data + googleplaystore data

	Attributes/Features:
	-Genre
	-Age
	-Interaction
	-Company Experience
	-Monetary
		-Ads
		-Microtransactions
		-Price

	Outcomes Variables:
	-Downloads
	-Rating

	Other Variables to Consider:
	-Release Date
	-# of Reviews

Success Factors

	Ratings:
	-Qualitative measure for user enjoyment
	-Weakness: Results may be skewed where very little votes influence the final result and may nto be the 'true' rating i.e. need 
	large enough votes to get more accurate assessment of rating
	-To mitigate weakness, establish threshold with # of minimum reviews 
	
	Number of Installs
	-Quantitative measure of how many users are interested/engaged in game
	-Weakness: Only given absolute measure and therefore influenced by time (should be inverse log relationship over time)
	-To mitigate weakness, adjust the installs for time i.e. average out total installs per year, and measure against same segment (year)

Relationship between success factors

-There appears to be an inverse log relationship between installs # & ratings
-Combine the two factors into one singular metric that evaluates overall success using PCA

Feature Analysis

-General high level breakdown/plot of various features against our created metric
-General shape of our features in our dataset

Machine Learning

-Use PCA & clustering on outcome variables
-Use regression of features against our metric to see coefficient/p-value testing
-Use random forest to predict clusters to see what predicts the clusters best

Discussion of Machine Learning
-Discuss PCA metric & cluster relationships
-Discuss regression results
-Discuss random forest results

Summarized Conclusions
-Restate our question
-Discuss our success metric
-Discuss certain features we think are important
-Discuss ML results & observations
