Agenda/Notes - Mar 23, 2021


1) Brainstorm ideas/progression:

Preprocessing/DB Structure
	-Create separate table to determine if there is more than 1 game produced by given company
	-Separate table of company size based on # of downloads
	
Analysis
	-Use density plots to determine where data starts falling off to cut out data
	-Use p-value to determine linearity of features?
	-How else can we use certain features we had removed

Machine Learning
	-Add additional features and run through models
	-Do we build another model to predict # of downloads or taken together as a singular metric?
	-Keep linear model as reference?
	-Use supervised learning to compute produce model e.g. random forest
	-Use neural network to produce better model	

Presentation
	-How do we have an interactive element to our project?
	-What should we present in terms of graphics?

2) Next steps

-Split up to work on certain features individually and collab on Thurs to review work
