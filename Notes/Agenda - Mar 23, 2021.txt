Agenda/Notes - Mar 23, 2021


1) Brainstorm ideas/progression:

Preprocessing/DB Structure
	-On main table, group metrics into a discrete variable from 0 to 5... may need to round ratings data
	-Create separate table grouped by company
		-count of # of unique games made 
			-> make variable of experienced vs unexperienced
		-count of total downloads 
			-> use clustering to figure out best fit groups for size i.e. small/med/large
		-export as separate csv
	-Export tables to sql, use query to join the two tables			

Analysis
	-Use density plots to determine where data starts falling off to cut out data
	-Use chi-square to determine significance of features
		-build contingency table based on encoded columns
		-run chi-square to determine significance of features
		-remove certain features not meeting threshold?
	-How else can we use certain features we had removed

Machine Learning
	-Add additional features and run through models
	-Do we build another model to predict # of downloads or taken together as a singular metric?
	-Should run logistical instead of linear model
	-Use supervised learning to compute produce model e.g. random forest
	-Use neural network to produce better model

Presentation
	-How do we have an interactive element to our project?
	-What should we present in terms of graphics?

2) Next steps

-Split up to work on certain features individually and collab on Thurs to review work
