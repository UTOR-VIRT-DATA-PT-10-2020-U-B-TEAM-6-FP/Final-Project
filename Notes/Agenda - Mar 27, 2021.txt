Agenda - Mar 27, 2021

1) Project Strategy

-We want to find out whats important to game apps in general to drive further questions.
-First clean up data and create any additional features we think are important to have (Preprocessing)
-Do some surface exploratory analysis (like what we had on PowerBI) to come up with a story of features (Tableau)
	-Are there any differences in genre ratings?
	-Peak downloads?
	-Are game apps increasing over time?
	-Bin ratings on bar chart...see that there might be a survivorship bias issue
	-Breakdown of genres by %
	-Ads vs no ad games -> breakdown by downloads
-Do unsupervised learning i.e. PCA, to see if all variables can be better explained by grouping them together (ML)
	-if PCA high, evaluate individual components by looking at eigan values which explains individual component breakdowns
	-if PCA low, means certain components are 'noisy' and we come up with theories which ones we should remove
-What have we learned based on PCA? Can we use this to drive a predictive model for tuning purposes?
-Should we mold the datasets differently and perform different clustering analysis on it?
-What if we're just interested in monetizing the game, can we focus on those features only and see if they impact the clustering and/or predictive model?
-Are there certain genres that are favored?
-Can we prove survivorship bias issue between rating score/reviews i.e. relationship between time (release & update), ratings and # of reviews

2) Coding

-Preprocessing
	-create grouped table off original
	-clean other dataset & transform dates to date values
	-join datasets to main via SQL query
-Machine Learning
	-drop irrelevant columns
	-perform PCA and evaluate results
	-build a story based on our clustering results and drive further questions

3) Next Steps

-Analyze the dataset individually to come up with more questions to be answered
-Build storyboard/further questions through our results
-Produce short slides for presentation for next Thurs

Notes

-Use preliminary analysis i.e. what we did on PowerBI to glean some interesting trends
-Use unsupervised learning on final dataset or on different tables to find interesting trends/analysis e.g. use clustering on the grouped table
-Due to complexity with # of features in our dataset, we should use PCA to better cluster our data
-If our explained PCA is high, then variables are correlated?
-Conversely, if PCA explained is low, our variables have low correlation? Means its noisy or features are causing colinearity to mess up, therefore may want to remove certain features for better explainatory power.
