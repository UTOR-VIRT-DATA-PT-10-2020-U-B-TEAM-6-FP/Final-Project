Pseudo Coding

Preprocessing

-import file
-filter game = 1
-fix dtypes
-determine threshold 'low' number of reviews
	-find out distribution on 'numberreviews' -> determine what 'low' is
-filter out if less than x number of 'numberreviews'
-dump all rows with no rating
-drop columns

-look at 'error during scraping' and determine if it needs to be dropped
-nan/other errors -> drop rows of data
	-look at distribution after dropping to have enough data in ratings bucket/density plot
		-round ratings/groupby and see distribution


Machine Learning

-encode object based columns
-scale data
-train/test split
-linear model
