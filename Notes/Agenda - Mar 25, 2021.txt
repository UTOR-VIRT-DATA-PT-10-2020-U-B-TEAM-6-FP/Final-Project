Agenda/Notes - Mar 25, 2021

1) Findings

Calvin:

-tested using p-values of independent variables, most of them do not exceed threshold i.e. cannot reject null hypothesis
-tried using chi-square, but it is supposed to only test 1 dependent and 1 independent variable
-did some powerbi visualization, found most ratings clustered around 4...therefore may not be good to round ratings data as proposed
-may need to change output variable as it does not seem any one particular parameter is influencing it right now
-may need to take out # of reviews removal of data points for more data

2) Pseudo Coding:

Preprocessing/DB Structure
	-On main table, group metrics into a discrete variable from 0 to 5... may need to round ratings data
	-Create separate table grouped by company
		-count of # of unique games made 
			-> make variable of experienced (1<) vs unexperienced (1)
		-count of total downloads 
			-> use clustering to figure out best fit groups for size i.e. small/med/larg
		-export as separate csv
	-Normalization of data
	-Export tables to sql, use query to join the two tables			

Machine Learning
	-Add additional features and run model
	-Should run logistical instead of linear model
	-Use supervised learning to compute produce model e.g. random forest
	-Use neural network to produce better model

Analysis/Presentation
	-Co-linearity amongst features e.g. gambling & micro-transactions 
		-tough to do because all our outcomes are binary (see seaborn graph)
	-Find distribution of data (see Power BI doc)
		-Bin ratings into count bar chart
		-Paid vs free games
		-Genre breakdown of all games
		-Age rating breakdown of games
		-Drill down ratings based on genre/rating to notice trends
		-Downloads
	-How do we have an interactive element to our project?
		-Dashboard -> rate your game app based on tuning parameters?
		-Drill downs with PowerBI
	-Questions to answer?
		-What features do you think are important?
		-Expand on those features where we think are really important/interesting like genre, paid vs free app, age rating, do ads annoy people enough, etc.
